## Overview

`apps/splitty` is an example split application.  It can be paired with slinky to form an application.

## Split Image

Split applications allow the user to build the application content separate from the library content by splitting an application into two pieces:

* A "loader" which contains a separate application that can perform upgrades and manage split images
* A "split app" which contains the main application content and references the libraries in the loader by static linkage

See [split image architecture](http://mynewt.apache.org/latest/os/modules/split/split/) for the details of split image design.

## Contents

splitty is just a simply app that has newtmgr, shell and blinkys the LED at a differernt rate than slinky, so its visually evident that its running.

## Usage

You can use splitty as part of a split app by setting up your target.

```
targets/app
    app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/splitty
    loader=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky
    bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52dk
    build_profile=optimized
```
