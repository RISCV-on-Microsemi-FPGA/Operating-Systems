# Console

There are two versions of this library;
  * full - contains actual implemetation
  * stub - has stubs for the API

You can write a package which uses ```console_printf()```, and builder of a
project can select which one they'll use.
For the package, list in the pkg.yml console as the required capability.
Project builder will then include either sys/console/full or
sys/console/stub as their choice.
