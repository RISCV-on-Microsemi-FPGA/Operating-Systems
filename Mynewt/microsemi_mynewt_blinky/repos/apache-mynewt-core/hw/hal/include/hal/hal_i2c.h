/**
 * This is the API for an i2c bus.  Currently, this is a master API
 * allowing the mynewt device to function as an I2C master.
 *
 * A slave API is pending for future release
 *
 * Typical usage of this API is as follows:
 *
 * Initialize an i2c device with:
 *      hal_i2c_init()
 *
 * When you wish to perform an i2c transaction, you call one or both of:
 *      hal_i2c_master_write();
 *      hal_i2c_master_read();
 *
 * These functions will issue a START condition, followed by the device's
 * 7-bit I2C address, and then send or receive the payload based on the data
 * provided. This will cause a repeated start on the bus, which is valid in
 * I2C specification, and the decision to use repeated starts was made to
 * simplify the I2C HAL. To set the STOP condition at an appropriate moment,
 * you set the `last_op` field to a `1` in either function.
 *
 * For example, in an I2C memory access you might write a register address and
 * then read data back via:
 *      hal_i2c_write(); -- write to a specific register on the device
 *      hal_i2c_read(); --- read back data, setting 'last_op' to '1'
